<p><strong>The Operators of nascondino take DMCA reports very seriously.</strong></p>

<p>This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy ("Policy") applies to the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/">nascondino</a> website ("Website" or "Service") and any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services") and outlines how this Website operator ("Operator", "we", "us" or "our") addresses copyright infringement notifications and how you ("you" or "your") may submit a copyright infringement complaint.</p>

<h2>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h2>
<p>Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether the use could be considered fair use. Fair use states that brief excerpts of copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research, without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder.</p>
<p>The DMCA requires you to provide your personal information in the copyright infringement notification. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of such notification.</p>

<h2>Notifications of infringement</h2>
<p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any material available on our Services infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a written copyright infringement notification ("Notification") using the contact details below pursuant to the DMCA. All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA requirements.</p>
<p>The Operator reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.</p>

<h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Website and Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.</p>
<p>An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes.</p>
