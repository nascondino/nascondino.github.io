Nascondino is an Enciclopedia of all the majors Italian companies that work in the spyware and digital surveillance sector and that provide Governments with such technologies and capabilities.

All the information contained in the Enciclopedia come from the Public Domain and, as such, they consist of fair-use and are reported on the website as news and/or as historic records.

Considered that working in the digital surveillance field is (still) legal under the Italian law, We believe that the public should be at least informed about the use of such risky technologies that can easily be mishandled and abused.

As history have teached Us with the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/08/13/ethiopia-hacking-team-lax-evidence-abuse">Hacking Team practices in Ethiopia that facilitated human rights abuses</a>, We learbed that We should keep our eyes on those companies, their trading partners, their technologies and monitor them closely to avoid further abuses.
