**Hacking Team** was an italian information technology company.  
Founded in 2003, **Hacking Team** flagship tools were **RCS DaVinci** and **RCS Galileo** - two versions of the same product.

The tools allowed law enforcement to monitor a suspectâ€™s cell phone conversations (Skype, WhatsApp, Viber), emails, and calls, spy on the target through his or her webcam and microphone, record the keystrokes and the screen, and infect target computer's UEFI BIOS firmware with a rootkit.[[1](#external-references)]  
The tool contained spyware agents for all various kind of devices (Blackberry, Symbian, iOS, WindowsMobile, etc) that could be installed manually by law enforcement, or through a previously infected PC.[[2](#external-references)]

In 2015, **Hacking Team** suffered a major data breach of customer data, software code, internal documents and e-mails.  
The leaked documents suggested that among their clients were the governments and security services of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Russia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, many of whom have been criticised by international human rights organisations for their aggressive surveillance of citizens, activists and journalists both domestically and overseas.[[3](#external-references)].  
**Hacking Team**'s tools were also leaked and published on GitHub.[[4](#external-references)]

In 2019, **Hacking Team** was acquired by **InTheCyber Group** to create **[Memento Labs](/companies/mementolabs.html)**.[[5](#external-references)][[6](#external-references)]
