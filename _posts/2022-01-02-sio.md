**SIO** is an italian information technology company.  
Founded in 2003, **SIO** initial focus was in wiretap and location trackers that evolved into their **Xtreme** product line.[[1](#external-references)][[2](#external-references)]

In 2021, **SIO** was found reselling **Cy4Gate** spyware *Epeius*.  
The Italian's prosecutor office of Naples later briefly suspended **SIO**'s wiretapping authorization.[[3](#external-references)][[4](#external-references)]

After acquiring [**ASIGINT**](/companies/asigint.html) in 2019/2020, **SIO** started distributing the "**Spyrtacus**" spyware on the Google Play.

In 2025 it was reported that the spyware was not available on the Store but it is still distributed by targeted web pages posing as WhatsApp and other popular apps.[[5](#external-references)][[6](#external-references)]
