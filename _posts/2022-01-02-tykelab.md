**Tykelab** is an italian information technology , part of the **[Cy4Gate](/companies/cy4gate.html)** group along with **[RCS](/companies/rcs.html)**.  
Founded in 2010, **Tykelab** main focus is network surveillance.

Specifically, **Tykelab**, uses dozens of rented or vulnerable phone networks, often on remote Pacific islands, to send tens of thousands of secret "tracking packets" to devices around the world. Targeting people in countries including Libya, Nicaragua, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Iraq, Mali, Greece and Portugal – as well as in Italy itself.[[1](#external-references)]

**Tykelab** does this by exploiting longstanding but frequently unfixed vulnerabilities in global phone networks which make it possible for third parties to see phone users’ locations, and potentially intercept their calls, without any record of compromise being left on their devices.[[2](#external-references)]
