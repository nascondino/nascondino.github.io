**Negg**, also known as **Negg International**, is an italian information technology company.  
Founded in 2013, **Negg**'s flagship product, unofficially named Exodus, was comprised of a Android & iOS spyware and its C2 infrastructure.

In 2018, Kaspersky discovered the "*Skygofree*" spyware made by **Negg**.  
The spyware was hosted on unique links with "phishing" pages that resembled typical ISP page and alterted the user about network connectivity configuration being outdated or broken.[[1](#external-references)][[2](#external-references)]

The *Android spyware* required the victim to enable installation of applications from unknown sources, and contained a number of publicly available exploits (CVE-2013-2094, CVE-2013-2595, CVE-2013-6282, CVE-2014-3153, and CVE-2015-3636) to perform privilege escalations.

The *Windown version* was written in Python and packed to binary files via the Py2exe tool. This sort of conversion allows Python code to be run in a Windows environment without pre-installed Python binaries, but also allow the Python source code to be recovered.

Later in 2018, Vice's Motherboard repoted that Kaspersky also found an *iOS version* of the spyware. This required the installation through Apple's MDM, that can be used to take full control over user devices but are very noticeable.[[3](#external-references)][[4](#external-references)]

*This company is also listed on [Surveillance Watch](https://www.surveillancewatch.io/?entity=Negg+Group).*
