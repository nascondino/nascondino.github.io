**DataForense** was an italian information technology company.  
Founded in 2013, it went bankrupt and is waiting to be liquidated and sold.[[1](#external-references)]

In 2019/2020 it started distributing the "**Spyrtacus**" spyware on the Google Play Store.  
Some of its ex-members later founded [**ASIGINT**](/companies/asigint.html) and brought the **Spyrtacus** project along with them to the new company.[[2](#external-references)]
