**RCS**, also known as **RCS Lab** or **ETM Sicurezza**, is an italian information technology , part of the **[Cy4Gate](/companies/cy4gate.html)** group along with **[Tykelab](/companies/tykelab.html)**.  
Founded in 1992, **RCS** main focus is mobile device spyware.

As early as 2012, **RCS** was a reseller of **[Hacking Team](/companies/hackingteam.html)**'s surveillance software to various problematic governments like Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.[[1](#external-references)]

In 2022, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered the "*Hermit*" spyware made by **RCS**.  
The spyware was hosted on unique links sent to the victim via SMS while the ISP, in accordance with **RCS**, disabled data connectivity of the victim.

The *iOS spyware* was signed through the [Apple Developer Enterprise](https://support.apple.com/en-bw/guide/deployment/depce7cefc4d/web) program, and contained a number of publicly available exploits (CVE-2018-4344, CVE-2019-8605, CVE-2020-3837, and CVE-2020-9907) and 0-day exploits (CVE-2021-30883, and CVE-2021-30983).[[2](#external-references)]  

The *Android version* required the victim to enable installation of applications from unknown sources, and didn't contained any 0-days out-of-the-box but the code contained hints about such capabilities.[[3](#external-references)][[4](#external-references)]

The "Hermit" spyware was deployed in Kazakhstan and Syria, both countries with poor human rights records, and Italy.[[5](#external-references)]
