**Cy4Gate** in an italian conglomerate of multiple spyware and surveillance companies (**[RCS](/companies/rcs.html)**, **[Tykelab](/companies/tykelab.html)**).  
Founded in 2014, **Cy4Gate** flagship products are *Epeius*, *Hydra* and *Gens.AI*.[[1](#external-references)]

*Epeius* is a spyware that can be installed on mobile devices to monitor a victim's activity, to extract their data, chats, photos, locations, email, etc.

*Hydra* allow to monitor a victim's network activity, detect which application are used, which website are visited, if VPNs or Tor are in use, etc.

*Gen.AI* is a tool that allow to create fake social personas for law enforcement agents to use on social networks to interact with victims to deploy the *Epeius* spyware or conduct disinformation campaign. 

In 2021, Citizen Lab and Vice's Motherboard found links between a fake version of WhatsApp and **Cy4Gate**, specifically its *Epeius* tool.[[2](#external-references)]  
The spyware was made of multiple stages. The first stage collected basic identifying information about the device (namely the IMEI code and the phone number).

This instance of *Epeius* was rented by **Cy4Gate** to **[SIO](/companies/sio.html)**. The Italian's prosecutor office of Naples later suspended the wiretapping authorization given to **[SIO](/companies/sio.html)**.

*This company is also listed on [Surveillance Watch](https://www.surveillancewatch.io/?entity=Cy4gate).*
